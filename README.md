# NotedIt

NotedIt is a chrome extension that uses [GoogleKeep](http://www.google.com/keep/) e [GoogleCalendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).

The main idea is: it's normal to have a lot of stuff to do and to remind it you can put a note at [GoogleKeep](http://www.google.com/keep/) or create an event at [GoogleCalendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).

Sometimes a task is about something you read at a news web-site, an e-mail, something someone said to you at chat, or even some task you told you would do to someone at facebook! You can't forget it, right? But you already forgot to put this information at calendar or notes, because the app was closed and the role process of open it was too much for you. So you definitely won't remember it now :disappointed:.

Thereby, the objective of NotedIt is to make easier to put anything at google notes or google calendar in a second, so you don't have to open the notes or calendar. It's much simpler, you just have to select the text you want to make a note or put at calendar, and click respectively alt + n or alt + c, and done!

NotedIt is my first chrome extension :smile:. I also plan to work at ChatOne, a chrome app to join facebook messenger, hangouts and whatsapp messenger at an unique chat that can be easily used. 

PS: yes, I like emojis :v:!
