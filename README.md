# NotedIt

The main idea is: it's normal to have a lot of stuff to do, and in order to remind it, put it at a note at GoogleKeep or as an event at GoogleCalendar.
Sometimes a task is about something you read at a news web-site, an e-mail, something someone said to you at chat, or even something you told you would do to someone at facebook! You can't forget it, right? But you already forgot to put this information at calendar or notes. So you definitely won't remember it now.

Thereby, the objective of NotedIt is to make it easier to put anything at google notes or google calendar in a second, so you don't have to open the notes or calendar. It's much simpler, you just have to select the text you want to make a note or put at calendar, and click respectively alt + n or alt + c, and done!

NoteIt is my first chrome extension. I'm also working at ChatOne, a chrome app to join facebook messenger, hangouts and whatsapp messenger at an unique chat that can be easily used.
